#### Project Deliverables
For this challenge, I worked on Flatdango, a mini web application where you can purchase movie tickets from the theater.

The user, is expected to be able to:

* See the first movie's details (poster, title, runtime, showtime and available tickets) when the page loads.
* See a menu on the left hand side of the page containing the rest of the movie's titles.
* Buy a ticket for a movie. (The number of tickets should decrease after a ticket is bought.)

Bonus Deliverables:
* Click ona movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's details with the new movie's details
* When a movie is sold out, indicate this by changing the button to "Sold Out"
* Add a sold out section for the films that are sold out

Extra Bonus Deliverables:
* When a ticket is purchased, persist the updated number of tickets sold on the server.
* Add a delete button next to each film that when clicked, deletes the film from the list as well as the server.
